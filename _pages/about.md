Hi! My name is Kai Guo (郭凯). I’m a master's student from the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, fortunately advised by Assoc Prof. [Hao Wang (王浩)](https://cshaowang.github.io/) and Prof. [Xi Peng (彭玺)](https://pengxi.me/). I also collaborate closely with Prof. [Peng Hu (胡鹏)](https://penghu-cs.github.io/).

My research interests lie in **multimodal learning** and **continual learning**, with a focus on disentangling and enhancing the robustness of multi-view representations, as well as on developing methods for multimodal continual learning.

[Disentangling Multi-view Representations via Curriculum Learning with Learnable Prior](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2025/0586.pdf)

**Kai Guo**, Jiedong Wang, Xi Peng, Peng Hu, Hao Wang

[**Code**](https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2025-IJCAI-CL2P) | [**中文简介**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Q01A_ERGSodmRR3Y0FLEQg) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This work reveals a coupling between neural networks' "easy-to-hard" preference in learning and the trade-off of view consistency vs. specificity.
